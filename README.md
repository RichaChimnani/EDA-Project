# Project-1



In this project we will consolidate the concepts of Data Analysis using various python libraries and SQL. We are provided with URL of two datasets on which we will be performing following analysis -

  1.  Get the Metadata from the above files.
  2.  Get the row names from the above files.
  3.  Change the column name from any of the above files.
  4.  Change the column name from any of the above file and store the changes made permanently.
  5.  Change the names of multiple columns.
  6.  Arrange values of a particular column in ascending order.
  7.  Arrange multiple column values in ascending order.
  8.  Make country as the first column of dataframe.
  9.  Get the column array using a variable.
  10. Get the subset rows 11, 24, 37
  11. Get the subset rows excluding 5, 12, 23 and 56
  12. Join users to transactions, keeping all rows from transactions and only matching rows from users(left join)
  13. Which transactions have a UserID not in users?
  14. Join users to transactions, keeping only rows from transactions and users that match via UserID(inner join)
  15. Join users to transactions, displaying all matching rows AND all non-matching rows (full outer join)
  16. Determine which sessions occured on the same day each user registered.
  17. Build a dataset with every possible (UserID,ProductID) pair (cross join)
  18. Determine how much quantity of each product was purchased by each user
  19. For each user, get each possible pair of pair transactions (TransactionlID1, TransactionlID2)
  20. Join each user to his/her first occuring transaction in the transactions table
  21. Test to see if we can drop columns
